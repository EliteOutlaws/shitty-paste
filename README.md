Embarassingly bad source that I worked on, kids ended up selling it and I don't think it's morally fine. 
Literally 1:1 csgo-sdk by pycache with some fixes: https://github.com/DubbleClick/csgo-sdk/
Here is it for everyone to enjoy and make fun of. Warning: horrible coding practices, etc, don't even go into the pasted part.
